# NHL Salary Prediction – Regression Ensemble

This project explores machine learning methods for predicting NHL player salaries using player performance and team-level data. Developed for a [Kaggle-hosted competition at the University of Waterloo](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/adv-regression/overview), the final model achieved **2nd place** on the [public leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/adv-regression/leaderboard).

## Methods Used

- Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing
- Feature engineering 
- Ensemble of the following models:
  - Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

## Files

- `NHL_Salary_Model.Rmd` – Full model development and evaluation in RMarkdown
- `report.pdf` – Exported summary report

## Result

- 2nd place on the public leaderboard  
- Final solution formed by averaging predictions from four tree-based models
